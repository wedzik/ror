Problem: 

You have just been brought on to a team which has been tasked with porting
a Ruby version of Mathematica.

Because you are new, you have been given a relatively easy task to 
write a class that displays polynomials, following some simple rules:

  - if a coefficient is 1, it doesn't get printed
  - if a coefficient is negative, you have to display something like "-5x^2", 
    not "+-5x^2"
  - if a coefficient is 0, nothing gets added to the output
  - for x^1 the ^1 part gets omitted
  - x^0 == 1, so omit it
  - if all of the coefficients are 0, the output is 0

Here's a couple of usage examples:

puts Polynomial.new([-5,-2,1,0,6]) # => -5x^4-2x^3+x^2+6
puts Polynomial.new([1,0,7]) # => x^2+7
puts Polynomial.new([0,0,0]) # => 0

If somebody tries to create a polynomial with less than 2 elements, 
your program has to raise ArgumentError.new("Two or more coefficients are required")

Please check the provided unit tests for more examples and make sure to use 
them for verifying your solution!
